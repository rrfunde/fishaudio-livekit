description: Commit changes, bump version, create tag, and push to remote
---

Perform a release:

1. Review and commit all current changes with a descriptive commit message
2. Bump the version in pyproject.toml (increment patch version)
3. Create a git tag for the new version (format: v{version})
4. Push both the commit and tag to the remote repository

Ask me for a commit message if the changes aren't clear from the diff.
